## Splitter Challenge

Made from :https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX

## Tools used

. HTML 5
. CSS 3
. Javascript (ES6+)

## My difficulties

My main trouble was on the "custom" input button and how to manage it while he's not in the others button loop.

I added some inputs verifications but we can still have some troubles mainly on the "Bill" input field

Last point was the CSS class added on percentage button selected and how to manage the add /remove of this class when we select an another button or even the "custom" field.

## Observation

I learned a lot about looping over a list of HTML nodes, How to use ParseFloat method and globally how to update in real-time a html field with new values.
